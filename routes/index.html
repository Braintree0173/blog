      &nbsp;I'm coming from a history of having used HTML in the late 90s when I had a copy of <i>Teach Yourself HTML Visually</i>, to getting a bit of a refresher in the early 2010s when my partner at the time was taking a course on web design so I at least got a peek into CSS by then, but I'm otherwise starting from scratch.
