      &nbsp;I'm coming from a history of having used HTML in the late 90s when I had a copy of <i>Teach Yourself HTML Visually</i>, to getting a bit of a refresher in the early 2010s when my partner at the time was taking a course on web design so I at least got a peek into CSS by then, but I'm otherwise starting from scratch.
      </br>I've dabbled in customizing the existing styles of sites to make them more user-friendly to me; whether that's using more or less screen real estate, or just colour customization.
